# If you were to perform a bubble sort on the following array, which is a possibility for what the second iteration might look like (i.e. after bubbling all the way up 2 times)?

# Initial
# [21, 4, 1, 3, 9, 20, 25]

# First Sort
# [21] [1, 4] [3, 9] [20, 25]

# Second Sort
# [1, 4, 21] [ 3, 9, 20, 25]
