## Lesson 3: Searching and Sorting

### What is Binary Search?
* Binary search essentially takes advantage of sorted arrays by initiating a comparison of the value at the middle of the array to see if the computer should search the upper or lower half of the array
* The efficiency of binary search is *O(log(n))*

### What is Recursion?
* Recursion is when a function calls itself

### What is Bubble Sort?
* Bubble sort is a naive approach to sorting (need to compare each element in the array)
* The efficiency of bubble sort is *O(n^2)* for the worst and average case. In the best case, the bubble sort would have an efficiency of *O(n)*

### What is Merge Sort?
* Merge sort is taking a big array, break it down, sort, then build it back up together after sorting is completed (divide and conquer)
* The efficiency of merge sort is *O(n*log(n))*

### What is a Quick Sort?
* Quick sort utilizes pivots to move values around based on whichever number is bigger or smaller
* The efficiency of quick sort is *O(n^2)* for the worst case and *O(n*log(n)) for the average and best case
