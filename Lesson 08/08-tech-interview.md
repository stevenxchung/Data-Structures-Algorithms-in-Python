## Lesson 8: Technical Interviewing Techniques

There are typically several parts which make up a technical interview:
* Clarifying the Question
* Confirming Inputs
* Test Cases
* Brainstorming
* Runtime Analysis
* Coding
* Debugging

### Clarifying the Question
* It is important to make sure you fully understand the question by clarifying it

### Confirming Inputs
* Confirming inputs not only confirms the signature of the algorithm but also helps you clarify the problem again and what we expect the results to be

### Test Cases
* Think about edge cases, i.e. what if the input is null, undefined, empty? This could help make the code more robust

### Brainstorming
* This step could be executed well if the previous steps were executed well, additionally, you could keep communication strong with the interviewer to clarify if you are on the right track (too often people forget that the interviewer is there to help)

### Runtime Analysis
* Analyzing runtime is important because the candidate may realize that his/her algorithm is not optimal and so perhaps more brainstorming is required

### Coding
* By successfully implementing the previous steps, coding becomes a lot easier, it's not necessary to read out each line of code but to explain to the interviewer what each major part of code does in steps while writing

### Debugging
* Using test cases to plug into the completed code could help find bugs, typos, and other small details which may have been left out
