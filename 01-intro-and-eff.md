# Lesson 1: Introduction and Efficiency

### What is efficiency?
* Efficiency or complexity refers to how well you are using the computer's resources to get a particular job done
* We can think about this in terms of space and time:
  * How much storage is needed?
  * How much time does it take for the job to complete?

### How can we describe code efficiency to others?
* Use Big-O notation to do so: *O(n)*
* What does *n* represent in *O(n)*?
  * *n* represents the length of the input
* Normally use approximation when talking about Big-O notation: *O(n + 1) ~= O(n)*
* Big-O is often discussed in the worst case scenario, however there is also a best case and an average case as well
* Big-O can be used to describe space and time efficiency
